Problem statement
What will be the output of the following code?

class Vehicle{
    String colour;
    private int number;
    void print()
    {
        System.out.println("vehicle");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle{
    void print()
    {
        System.out.println("car");
    }
}
class Honda extends Car{
    void print()
    {
        System.out.println("Honda");
    }
}
class buy_car{
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Car c=new Car();
        c.print();
    }
}


ans - car
In the provided code:

The Vehicle class has a method print() which prints "vehicle".
The Car class extends Vehicle and overrides the print() method to print "car".
The Honda class extends Car and overrides the print() method to print "Honda".
In the buy_car class, an instance of Car is created, and its print() method is called.
Since the instance created in buy_car is of type Car, the overridden method print() from the Car class will be invoked.

Therefore, the output will be: car
