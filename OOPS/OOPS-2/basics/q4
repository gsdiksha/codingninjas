Problem statement
What Is the o/p of following code

class Vehicle {
    int seats;
    int speed;

    public Vehicle(int seats, int speed) {
    System.out.print("Vehicle ");
    this.seats = seats;
    this.speed = speed;
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    int id;
    Car() {
    System.out.print("Car ");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
    Car c = new Car();
    }        
}

ans- compile error
in the car class, there is no explicit call to superclass vehicle (int seats, int speed) using super(). and vehicle class does not have a default constructor. so compile error
