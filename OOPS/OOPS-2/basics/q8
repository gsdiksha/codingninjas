Problem statement
What will be the output of the following code?

class ExceptionThrown 
{ 
    static int divideByZero(int a, int b){ 
        int i = a/b;  
        return i; 
    } 
    static int computeDivision(int a, int b) { 
        int res =0; 
        try
        { 
          res = divideByZero(a,b); 
        } 
        catch(NumberFormatException ex) 
        { 
           System.out.println("Exception occured");  
        } 
        return res; 
    } 
    public static void main(String args[]){ 
        int a = 1; 
        int b = 1; 
        int i=0;  
        try
        { 
             i = computeDivision(a,b); 

        } 
        catch(ArithmeticException ex) 
        { 
            System.out.println(ex.getMessage()); 
        }
        System.out.print(i);
    } 
} 

ans - 1
Explanation:

The main method initializes variables a and b to 1.
It then calls the computeDivision method with a and b.
In the computeDivision method, divideByZero method is called.
In the divideByZero method, integer division is performed (a/b), which is valid and results in 1.
This result is returned to the computeDivision method.
Since there is no NumberFormatException thrown in the try block of computeDivision, the catch block is not executed, and the result (1) is returned.
This result (1) is then assigned to variable i in the main method.
Finally, the value of i (which is 1) is printed.
There's no division by zero or any other arithmetic exception occurring, so the catch block for ArithmeticException is not executed.
