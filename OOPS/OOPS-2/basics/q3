Problem statement
The following class Vehicle, declares a protected variable name, inside package p1:

package p1;

public class Vehicle {
    protected String name;
}
Which of the following code(s) will give error?

A. 
package p1;

public class Car {
    void props() {
        Vehicle v = new Vehicle();
        v.name = "Vehicle 1st";      
    }
}

B. 
package p2;

class Car{
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Car c = new Car();
        c.name = "Ferrari";
    }
}

C. 
package p2;

import p1.Vehicle;
class Car {
    void props() {
        Vehicle v = new Vehicle();
        v.name = "BMW";
    }
}
D. 
package p2;
import p1.Vehicle;

class Car extends Vehicle {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Car c = new Car();
        c.name = "Ferrari";
    }
}


ans - b,c
b -This code will give an error because the Car class is not in the same package as the Vehicle class (p1), and it does not inherit from Vehicle. Therefore, it cannot access the protected name variable directly.
c -This code will give an error because the name variable in Vehicle is declared as protected, and Car is not a subclass of Vehicle. Even though Car is in a different package, importing Vehicle allows access to its protected members, but only if Car is a subclass of Vehicle, which it is not.
