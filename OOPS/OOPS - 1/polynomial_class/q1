Problem statement
What is the purpose of the Polynomial class's constructor that takes an integer array as an argument?

public class Polynomial {
    private int[] coefficients;
    public Polynomial(int[] coefficients) {
        this.coefficients = coefficients;
    }
    public int[] getCoefficients() {
        return coefficients;
    }
    public Polynomial add(Polynomial other) {
        int maxLength = Math.max(coefficients.length, other.coefficients.length);
        int[] resultCoefficients = new int[maxLength];
        for (int i = 0; i < coefficients.length; i++) {
            resultCoefficients[i] += coefficients[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < other.coefficients.length; i++) {
            resultCoefficients[i] += other.coefficients[i];
        }
        return new Polynomial(resultCoefficients);
    }
}


ans - to set the coefficients of the polynomial
