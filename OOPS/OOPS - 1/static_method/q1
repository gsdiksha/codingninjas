Problem statement
What will be the output of the following code?

class Car{
    static int year;
    String company_name;
}
class new_Car {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Car c=new Car();        
        Car.year=2018;              
        c.company_name="KIA";
        Car d=new Car();
        System.out.print(d.year);
    }
}


ans - 2018 
Car.year is a static variable, and when Car.year = 2018; is executed, it sets the static variable year in the Car class to 2018.
When Car d = new Car(); creates a new instance d of Car, it does not initialize year explicitly for this instance. Therefore, since year is a static variable and shared among all instances of Car, d.year will also have the value 2018 inherited from the class-level static variable.
Output Explanation:

Since d.year is accessing the static variable year from the Car class after it has been set to 2018, the output of System.out.print(d.year); will be 2018.
