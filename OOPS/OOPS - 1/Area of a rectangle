public class Rectangle {

    int length;
    int breadth;

    int getArea() {
         return length * breadth;
    }

}


Sample Input 1:
4 20
Sample Output 1:
80
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Length of the rectangle is 4 and breadth is 20. 
Hence the area of the rectangle is (length*breadth). 
So the answer is 4*20=80.
Sample Input 2:
2 10
Sample Output 2:
20
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
Length of the rectangle is 2 and breadth is 10. 
Hence the area of the rectangle is (length*breadth). 
So the answer is 2*10=20.
