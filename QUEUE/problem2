Problem statement
Suppose you are given an implementation of a queue of integers. The operations that can be performed on the queue are:

i. isEmpty (Q) — returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

ii. delete (Q) — deletes the element at the front of the queue and returns its value.

iii. insert (Q, i) — inserts the integer i at the rear of the queue.
Consider the following function:

void f (queue Q) { 
   int i ; 
   if (!isEmpty(Q)) { 
   i = delete(Q); 
   f(Q); 
   insert(Q, i); 
   } 
}

ans - reverse the elements of queue
To understand what the function f does, let's analyze it step-by-step with the given operations on the queue:

Function Definition:

The function f takes a queue Q as an argument.
If the queue Q is not empty (!isEmpty(Q)), it performs the following steps:
Deletes the front element of the queue and assigns it to i.
Recursively calls itself with the modified queue Q.
Inserts the value i back at the rear of the queue.
Behavior Analysis:

The function continues to delete elements from the front of the queue and makes recursive calls until the queue becomes empty.
Once the queue is empty, the base case (isEmpty(Q) is true) is reached, and the recursion starts to unwind.
During the unwinding of the recursion, each deleted element is reinserted at the rear of the queue in the reverse order of deletion.
Step-by-Step Example
Let's walk through an example to see how the function works:

Initial Queue: 
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
1,2,3,4

First Call:

!isEmpty(Q) is true.
i = delete(Q); → i = 1, queue becomes 
2
,
3
,
4
2,3,4.
f(Q); is called with 
2
,
3
,
4
2,3,4.
Second Call:

!isEmpty(Q) is true.
i = delete(Q); → i = 2, queue becomes 
3
,
4
3,4.
f(Q); is called with 
3
,
4
3,4.
Third Call:

!isEmpty(Q) is true.
i = delete(Q); → i = 3, queue becomes 
4
4.
f(Q); is called with 
4
4.
Fourth Call:

!isEmpty(Q) is true.
i = delete(Q); → i = 4, queue becomes 
.
f(Q); is called with 
.
Fifth Call:

isEmpty(Q) is true.
This is the base case, so the function returns without doing anything.
Now, the recursion starts to unwind:

Fourth Call Unwinds:

insert(Q, 4); → queue becomes 
4
4.
Third Call Unwinds:

insert(Q, 3); → queue becomes 
4
,
3
4,3.
Second Call Unwinds:

insert(Q, 2); → queue becomes 
4
,
3
,
2
4,3,2.
First Call Unwinds:

insert(Q, 1); → queue becomes 
4
,
3
,
2
,
1
4,3,2,1.
Summary
The function f takes a queue and recursively deletes all elements, then reinserts them in the reverse order. Essentially, it reverses the order of elements in the queue.

Initial Queue: 
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
1,2,3,4
Final Queue after f(Q): 
4
,
3
,
2
,
1
4,3,2,1
