If we perform rehashing when load factor is greater than 0.7, and the bucket size is 12 . For what value of size would we perform rehashing?

ans - The load factor is defined as the ratio of the number of elements (size) in the hash table to the number of buckets. When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, in this case, 0.7, rehashing is performed to maintain the efficiency of the hash table operations.

Given:

Bucket size = 12
Load factor threshold = 0.7
We need to find the value of size at which rehashing occurs.

Load Factor
=
size/
bucket size
=
0.7

Load Factor= 
bucket size
size
​
 =0.7
size
=
0.7
×
bucket size
=
0.7
×
12
=
8.4
size=0.7×bucket size=0.7×12=8.4
Since the size must be an integer (number of elements), rehashing would typically occur when the size exceeds 8.

Thus, rehashing would be performed when the size is 9.
