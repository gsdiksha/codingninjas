Consider the following pseudo-code that uses a Stack:

declare a stack of characters
while ( there are more characters in the word to read )
{
   read a character
   push the character on the stack
}
while ( the stack is not empty )
{
  pop a character off the stack
  write the character to the screen
}
What will be the output for "codingninjas"?
