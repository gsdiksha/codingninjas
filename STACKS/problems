1.Suppose we have 10 chairs(numbered 1 to 10 from top to bottom) placed on top of each other, now we remove the top 5 chairs and from the remaining 5 ,we again remove 2 chairs and place the previous 5 chairs back. Which numbered chair is at 6th position from the bottom?
ans - 3

2. What method is used in implementation of stacks?
ans - last in first out

3. Given an empty Stack and we perform following functions on the stack:

1. push(5)
2. push(3)
3. push(4)
4. pop()
5 push(2)
What is the size of stack now?
ans - 3

4. What would be the sum of elements of Stack after performing following functions:

1. push(5)
2. push(3)
3. push(4)
4. pop()
5. push(2)
ans - 10

5. What should be the return type of size function in stack?
ans - int

6. Which of the following statement(s) about stack data structure is/are NOT correct?
ans - stack is fifo, new node can be inserted from both ends.
correct - stack can be used using Linked list, new node can only be added at the top od stack

7. Which of the following operation take worst case i.e. linear time (O(n)) in the array implementation of stack?
ans - none(push,pop,isempty)

8. What would be the output for the following functions if the size of array used in stack is 5 ?

1. push(5)
2. push(4)
3. push(3)
4. push (2)
5. pop()
6. push(6)
7. push(8)
8. push(9)
9. print(size())  //to print the size of stack
ans - stackfullexception at line 8

9. What would be the output for the following functions (pop and size means printing also).

Note: No StackFullException occurs.

push(1) 
push(2)
push(3)
size()
pop
push(8)
pop
pop
pop 
ans - 3 3 8 2 1

10. What should be the sequence of push and pop to get the following output (pop means deleting and printing the deleted element) :

5 4 6 
ans - a. push(4) push(5) pop pop push(6)
      b. push(6,4,5) pop pop pop
      c. push(5) pop push(4) pop push(6) pop

11. If initially the size of array of stack is 3,and we need to input 34 elements. How many times the doublecapacity function would be called?
ans - 4
    From 3 to 6
From 6 to 12
From 12 to 24
From 24 to 48

12. Which of the following is true about linked list implementation of stack?

(A) In push operation, if new nodes are inserted at the beginning of linked list, then in pop operation, nodes must be removed from end.
(B) In push operation, if new nodes are inserted at the end, then in pop operation, nodes must be removed from the beginning.
ans - none

13. What would be the time complexity of the push and pop operations of the stack implemented using linked list (Assuming stack is implemented efficiently)?
ans - O(1) for both 
12. What is the time complexity of doublecapacity function of stack?

(n is the size of previous array).
ans - O(n)
