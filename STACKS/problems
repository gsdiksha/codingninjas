1.Suppose we have 10 chairs(numbered 1 to 10 from top to bottom) placed on top of each other, now we remove the top 5 chairs and from the remaining 5 ,we again remove 2 chairs and place the previous 5 chairs back. Which numbered chair is at 6th position from the bottom?
ans - 3

2. What method is used in implementation of stacks?
ans - last in first out

3. Given an empty Stack and we perform following functions on the stack:

1. push(5)
2. push(3)
3. push(4)
4. pop()
5 push(2)
What is the size of stack now?
ans - 3

4. What would be the sum of elements of Stack after performing following functions:

1. push(5)
2. push(3)
3. push(4)
4. pop()
5. push(2)
ans - 10

5. What should be the return type of size function in stack?
ans - int

6. Which of the following statement(s) about stack data structure is/are NOT correct?
ans - stack is fifo, new node can be inserted from both ends.
correct - stack can be used using Linked list, new node can only be added at the top od stack

7. Which of the following operation take worst case i.e. linear time (O(n)) in the array implementation of stack?
ans - none(push,pop,isempty)

8. What would be the output for the following functions if the size of array used in stack is 5 ?

1. push(5)
2. push(4)
3. push(3)
4. push (2)
5. pop()
6. push(6)
7. push(8)
8. push(9)
9. print(size())  //to print the size of stack
ans - stackfullexception at line 8
